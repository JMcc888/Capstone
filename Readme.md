# Capstone Project Front-End

After being tasked with creating a simple front-end for my next presentation, I decided to create this repo to track all changes to the project.

This will all be done with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS at the moment, but the backend of the app will deal with other features including node packages.

If anything, this will just serve as a nice template for me to plugin the actual data to in the future

# Plus, using the CLI makes me an official #Hackerman
